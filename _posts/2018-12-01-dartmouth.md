# Exchange Semester — Dartmouth College

## 📝 Overview

During my exchange at **Dartmouth College**, I had the opportunity to study topics at the intersection of health technology, materials science, and engineering design. Being at Dartmouth allowed me to learn alongside some of the brightest minds in the world, while gaining hands-on experience working in advanced labs equipped with state-of-the-art tools.

My coursework combined both the technical and human aspects of engineering — with a strong focus on designing technology to improve health, safety, and real-world outcomes. I worked tirelessly on multiple design projects during my time ehere.

## 🎒 LitPak Backpack

While at Dartmouth, I also worked on design and development of the **LitPak Backpack** — a safety-focused wearable project that integrated LED lighting, conductive thread, and reflective materials to improve nighttime pedestrian visibility. 

- Conducted iterative user testing and material studies to optimize both usability and safety performance.
- Developed working prototypes using embedded electronics, sensors, and stitched circuit designs.
- Worked in cross-functional teams blending design, engineering, and real-world testing.
