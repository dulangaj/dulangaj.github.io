# 📝 Project Overview

This project was originally built as part of a university assignment, but quickly turned into something my friends and I actually used during our student days in Hong Kong.

We built a tool that allowed users to search restaurants on OpenRice (Hong Kong’s equivalent to Yelp) — but instead of relying on the platform’s default algorithm, we let users define their own weighting for various search factors: price, distance, ratings, and more. Essentially, it turned restaurant hunting into something more data-driven and personalized.

# 🔬 Study & Findings

As part of the project, we also analyzed real-world restaurant data to study what actually affects customer ratings in Hong Kong.
One particularly interesting insight:

Customer satisfaction generally increased with price — but only up to around HK$100 per person. After that, satisfaction levels plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns beyond that price point.

# 🔧 Technical Highlights
	•	Built web scraping & data collection scripts to pull live data from OpenRice.
	•	Developed a simple scoring algorithm that allowed user-defined weightings across multiple search criteria.
	•	Built correlation models to analyze price vs. favorability.
	•	Packaged the tool for real-world use while dining out during university.
