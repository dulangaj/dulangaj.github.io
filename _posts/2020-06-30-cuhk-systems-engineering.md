## 🎓 Overview

During my time at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, I combined coursework, projects, and extracurricular activities to build a strong foundation across software engineering, data science, and interdisciplinary teamwork.

## 🧪 Selected Projects

### Simulating the Spread of Opinions in Social Networks

For my final year project, I explored how opinions spread across social networks using mathematical modeling and simulations. Leveraging both the **DeGroot** and **Bounded Confidence** models, I analyzed how network structure, individual influence, and self-appraisal mechanisms affect opinion formation and consensus.

### OpenRice Scraper and Data Analyzer

As a side project, I built a data analysis pipeline for Hong Kong’s OpenRice (similar to Yelp) to study restaurant trends, pricing, and satisfaction levels:
