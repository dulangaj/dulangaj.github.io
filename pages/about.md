Hi, I’m Dulanga — a software engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, production-grade systems across fintech, backend services, and full-stack applications. I specialize in Java, Python, and REST API development, and have hands-on experience working with cloud platforms, relational databases, and automation pipelines.

Originally from Sri Lanka, I’ve worked in Hong Kong and am actively looking for new remote opportunities, with a strong interest in relocating to Australia or Singapore. My work blends clean code, practical problem-solving, and a strong focus on reliability, all backed by solid production on-call experience.

Outside of code, I enjoy travel, exploring new places, and learning how technology adapts across different cultures and markets — a perspective that fuels my passion for building global products.
